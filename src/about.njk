            <h2>Professional Photographer</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                I'm a passionate photographer with a love for capturing authentic moments. 
                My journey started by documenting everyday life—snapshots of people, places, 
                and fleeting expressions that tell a story. Over time, my camera became a bridge 
                connecting me to the beauty around us, from bustling cityscapes to tranquil dawn skies.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                When I'm not snapping photos, you can find me exploring new coffee shops, 
                venturing into nature for fresh inspiration, or simply enjoying a good book. 
                I believe in art that resonates with sincerity, and I hope my images reflect 
                the genuine moments of life’s vibrant tapestry. Thank you for visiting!
            </p>
